## Usage

## Development

## TODO

- Install dependencies: `conda env create -f environment.yml -n <name>`
- Activate the environment: `conda activate <name>`
- Install precommits: `pre-commit install`
- Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `<repo>` name and owning user or organization.
- Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `<repo>`).
- Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
